This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This project is part of a demo for the Quant Summit.  The purpose of this demo is to show:

* How a UI encourages model use.
* How even complex models can provide real time analytics with the right framework and hardware. 
* How to incorporate documentation into the process.
